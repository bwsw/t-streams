Welcome to T-streams's documentation!
=====================================

T-streams (transactional streams) is a Scala library and infrastructure components which implement transactional messaging, important for many practical applications including CEP (complex event processing), financial and business-critical systems that must handle an event exactly-once and sometimes at-least-once or at-most-once.

It is implemented with Scala 2.12, Apache Curator, Google Netty, Google Guava and other standard sound components purposed for the development of reliable distributed applications.
